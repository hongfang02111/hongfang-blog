#### Hand Eczema Prevention Guidelines
- Hands should be washed thoroughly for at least 20 s with a fragrance and preservative-free soap
- Pat dry the hands instead of rubbing them with a towel to minimize physical trauma. Avoid reusing/ sharing of a towel. Disposable paper napkins should be preferred
- Use alcohol-based hand rubs if hands are not visibly dirty as they have less irritant potential. Glycerol can be added to hand sanitizer for its moisturizing effect
- Always moisturize after hand wash while they are still damp with a fragrance-free light moisturizing lotion/cream. Choose a lipid-rich moisturizer at bedtime. Vegetable oils (coconut oil, olive oil) and petroleum jelly are inexpensive and easily accessible alternatives
- Any moisturizer must be applied after using hand sanitizer/ rub once they are dry. It does not interfere with their efficacy
- Do not wear rings/ jewelry to prevent trapping of soap and detergent beneath them
- Healthcare workers and persons using protective gloves should apply an adequate quantity of moisturizer after removing them 
- Never wash hands with soap after applying alcohol-based sanitizer and do not wear gloves on wet hands
- In case of development of hand eczema, seek dermatologist's advice either in person or through teleconsultation whichever is feasible
- Most cases of mild hand eczema respond to topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and emollients. Systemic steroids and immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate and cyclosporine may be required for severe cases. Self-medication should be strictly avoided.
