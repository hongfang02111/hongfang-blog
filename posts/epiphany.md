#### I Have an Epiphany Today
1. I realized I need to improve everyday and create a healthy environment. 
2. I want to be a healthy person in my spirit and body. For the rest of my day, I will learn as much as I can. I would like to use this knowledge to reach out and help others.
3. I have learned that I decided to live my life and be happy everyday. If I face a difficult situation, I  will keep a peaceful mind to deal with it .
4. It is very important for me not to complain. This will make my life much better. If I cannot change something, I will not spend my time on it.
